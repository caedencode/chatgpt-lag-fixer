**The ultimate performance booster for long ChatGPT conversations**

ChatGPT Lag Fixer is a **Chrome and Firefox** extension that uses intelligent virtual scrolling to keep your ChatGPT tabs lightning-fast, even during long conversations. Unlike simple DOM trimming solutions, this extension dynamically virtualizes messages outside your viewport while seamlessly restoring them as you scroll.

### ℹ️ Evolution of the Project (v1.0 vs v2.0)

I started this project as an open-source tool, and I’m proud of how much it has helped people. However, as the user base grew, maintaining it in my evenings alongside a full-time job became a massive commitment. 

To keep the project alive and sustainable **without** burning out, I made a few changes:

* **This Repository (v1.0):** Source is publicly available under the **PolyForm Strict License**. I’m keeping this public so the community can still use the original logic as a learning resource or a foundation for their own tools regarding DOM virtualization.
* **Web Store Version (v2.0+):** This version is **not open-sourced** at this point. It features a complete architectural rewrite that works with the current version of ChatGPT and includes a "Pro" tier for a small one-time fee for new heavy users (still free for casual users) to help cover a bit of the ongoing development time spent. I want to stress that this version still runs **100% locally on your device and does NOT collect any data.**

I want to be transparent about this shift—my goal is to ensure the extension stays fast, secure, and actively maintained for the long run.

## Technical Architecture

### How It Works
ChatGPT normally renders **every message in the DOM at once**, even if they are not visible.  
This extension fixes that by:

1. **Detection**: Scans ChatGPT's DOM structure to identify the message container
2. **Caching**: Stores message content, height, and metadata in memory
3. **Virtualization**: Replaces off-screen messages with height-matched placeholders
4. **Restoration**: Recreates messages from cache when scrolled into view
5. **Monitoring**: Watches for new messages via MutationObserver

This technique — **virtual scrolling** — is commonly used in high-performance apps like:

- Notion  
- Discord  
- Slack  
- VS Code  
- React Virtualized  

It makes massive message lists behave like small ones.

## Development Notes

### Running the extension during development:
- Load the extension locally in your browser
- Open the browser console on ChatGPT and look for debug logs (if enabled)
- Use the popup toggle to enable/disable virtualization
- When making changes, hit **Reload** on the extension page (for Chrome)

### Debug mode
The popup includes an optional "Debug mode" that logs internal states such as:
- Scroll container detection
- Virtualization passes
- Nodes rendered / unrendered
- URL changes
- Mutation observer triggers


## 🔐 Privacy

This extension:
- Collects **no data**
- Sends **nothing** to any server
- Reads/writes only its own local storage (settings)
- Runs **only** on ChatGPT domains (`chat.openai.com` / `chatgpt.com`)

All processing happens **fully locally** in your browser.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Install the extension
2. Open ChatGPT
3. Start a conversation
4. The extension works automatically! 🎉

### Accessing Settings
- Click the extension icon in your Chrome/Firefox toolbar
- See stats like nodes rendered, memory saved and more
- Enable debug mode to see what's happening behind the scenes

### Settings Explained

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Enable Virtual Scrolling** | Toggle virtualization on/off | ON |
| **Debug Mode** | Show console logs for debugging | OFF |

### Performance Stats

The popup displays real-time statistics:
- **Total Messages**: Number of messages in conversation
- **Rendered**: Currently rendered messages
- **Memory Saved**: Percentage of messages virtualized
- **Status**: Extension active/disabled state

## Performance Comparison

| Scenario | Without Extension | With Extension | Improvement |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 100 messages | ~800 DOM nodes | ~250 DOM nodes | **69% reduction** |
| 500 messages | ~4000 DOM nodes | ~300 DOM nodes | **92% reduction** |
| Scroll lag | Noticeable | Smooth | **Significantly better** |
| Memory usage | High | Low | **~60% less** |

2. Refresh the page after installing/updating
3. Enable debug mode and check console for errors
4. Try disabling and re-enabling the extension

### Messages not virtualizing?
1. Ensure "Enable Virtual Scrolling" is ON in settings
2. Check that you have enough messages (>10) in conversation
3. Check browser console for errors

### Scroll position jumping?
1. Disable extension temporarily to see if ChatGPT is the issue
2. Report the issue with reproduction steps
